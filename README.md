# wp-video-encrypt-base
Base for woocommerce product video encryption

This is a part of a specific theme development. 

Customer wanted a platform created using WordPress and Woocommerce to sell his training courses.

The videos ID's are simply encoded using openSSL so the user cannot download the video.
Some additional checks are planned to be made in the future.

## This is just a base. If this gets a final form somewhere I will write how to use it :)
